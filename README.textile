h1. jQueryUI contextmenu

h2. short description

p. Provides a simple wrapper for jQueryUI's menu (Please check "menu documentation":http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu if you want to learn more on menus events). If you take care yourself about the menu bindings this simple widget doesn't touch your menu layer.

h2. options

* pageX / pageY [ default 0 ] - use that if you call open yourself
* forceUrlHandling [ default true ] - As the menu currently prevents anchor clicks you should keep that activated if you want urls to be loaded. In that case an url has to start with http.
* menu - jQuery object of domnode
* menuOptions [default null] - uses defaults if you don't provide anything
* position - position rendering of contextmenu

h2. custom events

* before
* open
* close
    
h2. public methods

* open
* close
* closeall

Have fun :)
